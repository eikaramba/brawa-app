This Repo is the Android Source Code for the BRAWA App. To run it you will need to add a `/App_Ressources/Android/src/google-services.json` file with your Firebase project configuration. In addition a `.env.production` file with the correct production API URL is needed.

It uses Nativescript with Svelte.
