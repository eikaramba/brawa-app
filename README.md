This Repo is the Android Source Code for the BRAWA App. To run it you will need to add a `/App_Ressources/Android/src/google-services.json` file with your Firebase project configuration. In addition a `.env.production` file with the correct production API URL is needed.

It uses Nativescript with Svelte.

The Android App is available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brawa.android&hl=de&pli=1

You also need to run the Backend Code which can be found here: https://github.com/eikaramba/brawa-backend
